<h3 style="text-align: center; margin: 40px 0;">I am Kai, born to be devoted to computer world.</h3>

I can not image myself in a world without computers. In high school, I already made my decision to take a poistion in this industry. The times when people highly doubted the future of internet and computers, I never hold a second thought - it is the future.

Here in this blog, I am keeping records of my technical thoughts.

I read many blogs at the same time, and I know the loneliness in maintaining a blog is very common. So I am quite sure from the beginning that this blog is 95% for myself, and 5% for the rest of the world. But still hope you, my lovely precious reader, will benefit a little bit from my posts.
