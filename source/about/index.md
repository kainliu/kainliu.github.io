This blog is named after [Westworld](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475784/), a science fiction series by HBO. I started it when I was just moving from my safe zone in China, to the brand new college life in Europe. Just like a trip into the *West Wild*, some people warned me of the danger to lose, some blessed me for the chance to advance.
