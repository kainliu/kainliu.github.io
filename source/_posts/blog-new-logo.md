I always enjoy the icons with just black and white.

I do think the compact shape of logo can deliver essence of the product, the brand, or the concept.

The character `世` in Chinese origins from `Sanskrit`([wiki:世界](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C), [wiki:梵语](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit)), which means **all the times (in the past and future)**.

I find there lies a culture difference. `世界` (translation of `world`) and `宇宙` (translation of `universe`), in both eastern words, the first character stands for `all the times` and the latter for `all the spaces`.
In contrast, the word `world` in English refers to *the earth and all the people, places, and things on it*, and `universe` stands for *all existing matter and space considered as a whole*.

The concept of `times` is missing in western words.

I polished the shape of horizontal stroke (横) to create two sharp angles in the character. The character will eventually roll over to left, the sharp angle will keep it more stable if stick into the ground.
