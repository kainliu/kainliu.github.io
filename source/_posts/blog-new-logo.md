I always enjoy the icon designs in just black and white. Leaving the shapes to deliver the idea.

I do think a nice logo design, a compact style icon, can deliver the essence spirit of a product, a brand, or a company.

The Chinese character `世` origins from `Sanskrit`([wiki:世界](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C), [wiki:梵语](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit)), which means **all the times (in the past and future)**.

I polished the shape of the first horizontal stroke of the Chinese character `世` to create two sharp angles in the character. The character will eventually roll over to left, the sharp angle will keep it more stable if stick into the ground.

### Times

I find there lies a culture difference. Thinking about `世界`(`world`) and `宇宙`(`universe`), we find that in both eastern words, the first character stands for `all the times` and the latter for `all the spaces`.

In contrast, the word `world` in English refers to *the earth and all the people, places, and things on it*, and `universe` stands for *all existing matter and space considered as a whole*.

The concept of `times` is somehow missing.
